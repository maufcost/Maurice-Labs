# Mauricio-Labs

Hello! I am Mauricio Costa, and I have started a small show on Youtube where I create software and applications from famous series and movies that contribute to the comedy of these TV shows.
It's summer and time to meet new people, have different experiences, and experiment new things.

I am always open to feedback and questions! 

You can reach me out on:
