This week, I have built the Doomsday Device (aka Accountability Booster) from The Office series.

This is the second episode of my show on Youtube, where I recreate famous software and applications from movies and TV shows.

You can see the video where I built it here: https://youtu.be/WxkZMDmDQcs

I hope you enjoy!
